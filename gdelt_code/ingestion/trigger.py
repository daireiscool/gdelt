Description:
Code to ingest data and save it to a location (local/cloud)

Note:
Need to find a way to stop the function ending.
    Code pushes the bash script to the background (so can use all resources)
    Since they are in the background, python doesnt detect them and closes.
    This will cause python script to close early, while bash code still running
